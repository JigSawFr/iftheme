Institut Français Theme for WordPress by SMOL


Concept
=======
IF theme for WP is based on top categories (level 0) and users.
The couple: [1 categ level-0 + 1 user] == 1 antenna
You can make multi antennas websites or single antenna (only 1 top categ and the super-admin user). After that the navigation menu is made of categories and child categories. Posts are events.

This theme was made for all the Institut Français all over the world that wanted an easy way to get a website with the look of the IF graphical charter.

You are free to use it and modify it for your own needs.
Any improvment are welcome ;-)
